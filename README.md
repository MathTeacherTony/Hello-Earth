# Hello-Earth
This is my first repository at GitHub

I am starting an app-development phase to my career. I've taught full time for the last seven or eight years and learned a lot about classroom teaching and educational technology.

I think there is a lot of room for my ideas to turn into practical, perhaps-profitable, applications.

Stay tuned. . .
